# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
@ Ans: Because I want to share my repository with others through internet.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
@ Ans: Because when you are working on something locally, you don't want to sync up with 
       other people's changes until you feel ready to.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
  instead of another?
@ Ans: Fork is effectively the same as doing git clone on github's server. And github 
       made it easier to reference to the original author of the code and contribute to
       the original author's repository by using fork.
       Clone is a git feature to duplicate a repository from a remote repository.
       Branch is just a label on a commit that help describe the relationships between 
       commits.
