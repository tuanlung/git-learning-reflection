# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
@ Ans: Git will create a .git directory and start to trace all changes. We need to do this
       to make it a git repository 

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
  What value do you think it offers?
@ Ans: Staging area provides a space to record changes that users want to commit in the future.
       On the other hand, working directory can have other files that users don't want to 
       track. 
       And the repository stores only committed changes. 

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
@ Ans: With multiple files being edited, we can add logically related ones to staging area 
       and commit them at a time. Then do the same for the other files.
