# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
@ Ans: Git will create a .git directory and start to trace all changes. We need to do this
       to make it a git repository 

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
  What value do you think it offers?
@ Ans: Staging area provides a space to record changes that users want to commit in the future.
       On the other hand, working directory can have other files that users don't want to 
       track. 
       And the repository stores only committed changes.
